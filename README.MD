# Cruise Ships

This is a JavaScript exercise in object dependency, created as part of my studies with the Command Shift bootcamp.

## Installation

The project is designed to be run locally in the browser.

To clone the project to your machine, navigate to your desired directory in the terminal and run:

`git clone https://github.com/JordsCodes/cruise-ships`

To run the project, navigate to the cruise-ships directory in the terminal and run:

`open index.html`
## Usage

The project simulates a cruise ship. In the src folder you will find js files for ship, itinerary, port, and controller. Port objects are instantiated and passed into Itinerary objects, and these Itinerary objects are passed into the Ship object.

Opening index.html grants the user a visual representation of the project. The ship object is presently hardcoded to a pre-set itinerary of ports, located in the index.html file. 

At the time of writing, the gui does not allow for itinerary customisation. If you would like to change the itinerary you will therefore need to edit the index.html file.
